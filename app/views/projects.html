			The project revolves around the state-wise analysis of Power Consumption and Demand in India with the data obtained from the government website data.gov.in. This project aims to provide a visual overview of the data, and aid in generating some predictions and insights regarding power in India using a Dashboard.	The data was available as .csv file for each month, on the website. The initial phase involved data preparation, which required 136 .csv files to be merged into a master data set using MySQL and some Linux scripting. The discrepancies and inconsistencies in data and the data-formats were addressed (For example, Andhra Pradesh was split to form a new state Telangana; Orissa was renamed as Odisha). The prepared data was then used to construct a Dashboard with the aid of the software Tableau. The Dashboard is categorised into various tabs like Summary,Time-Analysis and so on. These help the user visualize several aspects of the data. At the outset, the user finds a set of filters and parameters on the right hand side of the dashboard such as Metric, Type, State, Month and Year. Altering these filters dynamically changes every infographic, thereby enabling the user to  select and scrutinize any subset of the data. The visualizations have been colour coded into a common colour scheme to give an intuitive understanding of the information. The Dashboard includes infographics clearly highlighting seasonal, yearly and state-wise trends.

		<p class="description">
			A large fraction of the work taken up by  BPOs involve cold calling the client for the sales of products outsourced to the company. Lots of manhours are wasted in the process as the BPO has no process which tracks the consumers preferences of purchase history which in turn help in improving the conversion rate of sales. The Analytics Club took one such project for a BPO company which intended to increase their conversion rate. Call records for more than 1 million consumers were analysed which included several features pertaining to consumers like their past buys, location , day of the call, time of the call and other demographic factors. The team was successfully able to build a model which could successfully rank any list of consumers based on the likelihood of a consumer to buy the product.
